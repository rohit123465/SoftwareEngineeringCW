# CS261 Group Project: Media Monitoring System

In the modern era, public figures and companies face constant scrutiny from the media and social platforms, which can significantly impact their public image and financial performance. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a Media Monitoring System that allows users to track publicly traded companies, receive updates about relevant news articles, and analyze the potential impact of these stories on public opinion and financial trends.
